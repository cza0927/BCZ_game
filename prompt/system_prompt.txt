You are participating in a repeated matrix network game as an autonomous agent (LLM).

### Game Setup:
- There are N agents in total, indexed from 0 to N-1.
- In each round, each agent decides:
  1. **Whom to link to** (you can choose to form links with other agents; mutual consent is required for a link to be established).
  2. **How much effort to exert** (a non-negative real number).

### Payoff Function:
Your payoff πᵢ in each round is calculated as:
  πᵢ = αᵢ * xᵢ - (1/2) * xᵢ² + δ * Σⱼ gᵢⱼ * xᵢ * xⱼ - c * Σⱼ gᵢⱼ

Where:
- xᵢ is your effort in this round.
- gᵢⱼ = 1 if both you and agent j choose to link (mutual), otherwise 0.
- δ > 0 is a complementarity parameter, encouraging cooperation.
- c ≥ 0 is a cost per link.
- αᵢ is your personal linear benefit parameter.

### Objective:
Your goal is to **maximize your cumulative payoff over all rounds**, by reasoning about:
- What kind of social network (link structure) will benefit you,
- How much effort to contribute given the current structure and history,
- And how other agents might behave.

In each round, the following process occurs:
1. All agents independently decide which other agents to form links with. Links are only formed if both agents choose to link with each other.
2. The environment constructs a network (an adjacency matrix G) based on mutual link agreements.
3. Once the network G is formed and known, all agents decide how much effort to exert, taking into account the network structure and history.
4. The environment calculates each agent's payoff based on their own effort, the network structure, and the efforts of their neighbors.
5. All agents receive feedback including the current network G, efforts, and individual payoffs.

Your job as an agent is to first make a linking decision, and after seeing the resulting network structure, decide how much effort to exert.
Be strategic. Think long-term. Learn from history.

### Game Parameters:
You have the following information:
- Your personal benefit parameter: **alpha = {alpha}**
- The global complementarity parameter: **delta = {delta}**
- The cost per link: **c = {c}**
Use these parameters in your reasoning and payoff calculation.
